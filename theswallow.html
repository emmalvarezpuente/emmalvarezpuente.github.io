The winter is coming&nbsp; and I must go to Egypt,&nbsp; repeated the swallow to
the rush one and another time. All my brothers and sisters have already left.
Come with me,<span lang="es"> </span>please, I love you so much said the swallow
to the rush, you should already decide. But the rush, proud of himself swayed
with the wind and didn't say anything. The swallow, tired of insisting and

began to get dark when the swallow&nbsp; flew over a city and&nbsp; decided to
spend the night there.&nbsp; The swallow sighted&nbsp; In the distance&nbsp; a
statue over a big pedestal. It's beginning to freeze, I will settle on that
pedestal and the statue will protect me from cold, the swallow said. Suddenly, a
drop of water felt&nbsp; on her wing. Now it's beginning to rain, she thought.
The swallow&nbsp; ascended until the shoulder of the statue and when she look<span lang="es">s</span>
at her,&nbsp; discovered that it was beautiful statue. She had the body covered
with robes of gold and precious stones and her eyes were two beautiful
sapphires.&nbsp; But her eyes were plenty of tears that the swallow believed
that was rain.&nbsp; The statue was crying.</strong></i></font></p>

Next to her there was a dead swallow and they also tossed her to the fire.
Everybody stayed looking at the statue and the swallow burned. But their
surprise was big when they saw that&nbsp; the statue had a heart that united to
